[["index.html", "Methodological Manual ELSOC 2016-2021 Presentation", " Methodological Manual ELSOC 2016-2021 ELSOC Team Presentation The Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC) is a study to analyze the evolution of conflict and cohesion in Chilean society through time, based on conceptual models defined in the national and international literature that address these issues. It is oriented to examine the main background, moderating and mediating factors, as well as the main consequences associated with the development of different forms of conflict and social cohesion in Chile. Its main objective is to become an empirical input for understanding Chileans beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions towards different dimensions of coexistence and conflict and how these change over time. This survey was designed by researchers from the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES). COES is sponsored by the University of Chile and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, with Diego Portales University and Adolfo Ibáñez University as partner institutions. For more information about COES, please visit its website (www.coes.cl/). Since 2013, the COES initiative has been funded by the Priority Research Centers Funding (FONDAP) of the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)1, an agency under the Chilean Ministry of Education. ELSOC data collection is publicly tendered every two years and has been awarded in all its measurements to the MicroData Center of the University of Chile (CMD). We structured the Manual around thematic sections: the first section describes the sample design of the panel study, divided into its original and refreshment samples, and the updates that we have developed over time. The second section describes the instrument design process and the studys technical report. The following section summarizes the main aspects of the fieldwork, emphasizing the particularities of the process of re-interviewing the participants. The fourth section presents the storage of database versions and points out the protocol for their use. Finally, we included a section with basic guidelines for analysis and the codebook.

"],["dis_muest_original.html", "1.1 Original Sample Design", " 1.1 Original Sample Design The design of the original ELSOC sample aimed to harmonise the multiple research interests of the researchers associated with the Center. Among the most relevant considerations were the following: A sample design that allowed combining the variables measured in the questionnaire with spatial variables, registered at block and commune level, contained in the databases developed by the Territorial Intelligence Center (CIT) of the Aldolfo Ibáñez University. The CIT data is not available for all the blocks in the country, particularly those located in rural localities, so we decided to include only urban areas in the sample. This deliberation also coincided with the preferences of many researchers at the Center, who were mainly interested in an urban sample. Some researchers requested a design that allows the estimation of multilevel (or hierarchical) models grouped by city and commune. Therefore, we resolved that the sample should contain a sufficient number of cities and communes, as well as a sufficient number of cases within each city and commune, to allow such analysis (Snijders &amp; Bosker, Chapter 10). Other researchers were interested in comparing inhabitants of the three largest cities in the country, which resulted in a non-proportional design that increased the number of respondents in the areas of Greater Valparaíso (cities of Viña del Mar and Valparaíso) and Greater Concepción (Concepción, Talcahuano and others). Finally, some researchers requested a design that allows the comparison of respondents living in large and small cities, favouring increasing the sample size of households in small cities (Kish, 1965, Section 3.5), particularly in those with between 30,000 and 100,000 inhabitants. COES researchers worked with a sampling design manager, Stephanie Eckman, to develop a design that reasonably met these substantive needs and interests. The final ELSOC-COES Wave 1 sampling design provides adequate coverage of the countrys largest cities (Greater Santiago, Greater Valparaíso and Greater Concepción) and smaller cities. Also, it ensures the representation of people in the north and south of the country. In general, the sampling design reaches approximate representativeness of 77% of the countrys total population and 93% of the urban population. The following subsections detail the different steps of the sampling design. Sampling Frame Setup The original sample sampling process was conducted based on the 2011 pre-census data, which the CIT formatted. Although the 2012 census population counts are not accurate, the pre-census work collecting housing information on all blocks is of quality. The dataset contained a total of 155,757 blocks, but we eliminated four different types before selection began. Following the analytical interests of the Centers researchers, only urban blocks were used. We used the coding of the type of locality (urban or rural) contained in the 2011 pre-census database to determine which blocks were urban. Consequently, we excluded 22,188 (14.2%) blocks in this step. Similarly, based on the analytical interests of the Centers researchers, only the blocks that had been previously geo-referenced by CIT were retained for sampling. This implies that we removed 1,971 (1.5% of the urban blocks) that were not geo-referenced in this step. We retained only blocks containing five or more households (according to 2011 pre-census). 503 blocks (less than 1% of the remaining blocks after steps 1 and 2) did not meet this threshold and were removed. Only blocks in cities with more than 10,000 individuals were eligible for selection. 10,238 blocks (7.8% of the remaining blocks) were excluded from the sampling frame. Thus, the final sampling frame contains 120,857 blocks. The COES sample will represent only these blocks and not those excluded. Estimates derived from the sample data will apply only to this target population and should not be applied to the entire Chilean population. The respondent selection process was developed in four stages, although a fifth stage was added during fieldwork. Stage 1: City Selection The universe of blocks (the 120,857 blocks mentioned above) was aggregated at the city level, resulting in 122 cities. The three largest cities (Greater Santiago, Viña del Mar - Valparaiso and Concepción - Talcahuano) were selected with certainty. The remaining cities were stratified by population. Table 1.1 shows the definitions of the strata and the population and sample sizes in each one. Table 1.1: Population by city and sample size, by stratum North Stratum South Stratum Stratum Definition (N° inhabitants) Cities population size Cities sample size Stratum population size Stratum sample size Stratum population size Stratum sample size Greater Santiago 1 1 Greater Valparaíso 1 1 Greater Concepción 1 1 Big cities &gt; 100 thousand 18 8 8 4 10 3 Medium cities &gt; 30 thousand 28 10 15 6 13 3 Small cities &gt; 10 thousand 73 19 24 6 49 13 The strata of large cities, medium-sized cities and small cities were stratified geographically by North or South zone to ensure that the sample contained cities in the north and south of Chile. This resulted in a total of nine strata. The sample was distributed between the two areas in proportion to their population size in the universe. See Table 1.1 for details about the population and sample sizes in each of the northern and southern strata. The selection of cities within each stratum was in proportion to the population size of each city. This method gives a higher probability of selection to large cities. The probability of selection of a city \\(i\\) within stratum \\(h\\) was: \\[\\pi_i=\\frac{(nc_h)(pop_i)}{\\sum_h pop}\\] where \\(nc_h\\) is the number of cities selected in stratum \\(h\\) and \\(pop_i\\) is the population of city \\(i\\). Stage 2: Block Selection The 40 selected cities contained 87,839 blocks. In the second stage, we selected blocks in each city with a population proportional to size, where size was determined from the pre-census household unit count. The selection was systematic: the list of blocks in the selected cities was ordered by census sub-district and block number to ensure that the selected blocks spread throughout the city2. Table 1.2 shows the number of blocks selected in each city, according to stratum. The sample of blocks was disproportionately distributed so that areas outside of Santiago would be over-represented relative to their size in the target population. Several COES researchers requested this distribution to ensure that the sample was diverse concerning city size. The probability of selection of a block \\(j\\) in city \\(i\\), conditional on city selection, was: \\[\\pi_{j|i}=\\frac{(nb_i)(hu_j)}{\\sum_i hu}\\] where \\(nb_i\\) is the number of blocks selected in city \\(i\\) and \\(hu_j\\) is the population of city \\(i\\). Table 1.2: Distribution of cities and blocks by strata Stratum Definition (N° inhabitants) Cities sample size Blocks number per city Blocks number Greater Santiago 1 200 200 Greater Valparaíso 1 100 100 Greater Concepción 1 100 100 Big cities &gt; 100 thousand 8 26 208 Medium cities &gt; 30 thousand 10 25 250 Small cities &gt; 10 thousand 19 11 209 Total 40 27 1080 In 4 cities, some blocks were extremely large so they were sure selections. The household unit counts were larger than the selection interval and would be selected in any sample and could even be selected twice. To avoid duplicate selections, we first selected these blocks with certainty. Additional blocks were selected from the remaining blocks for those cities to reach the citys desired total sample size (see Table 1.2. \\(\\pi_{j|i}\\) for these cities is 1. In the field, we registered the 1,067 blocks selected in the 40 selected cities to select the households with the most updated information possible. The CIT provided maps of each selected block. CMD field staff visited each block in person and created a registry of all household units in those blocks. We carefully reviewed the listings for any errors or duplicates. During the registration process, the CMD found that some blocks had more than 100 households, making the procedure excessively difficult. Consequently, we divided these blocks into sub-blocks of approximately equal size (40 to 50 households) and selected one for registration. Because we created sub-blocks to be of similar sizes, we selected them based on equal probability. In total, we subsampled 301 blocks. This step did not affect the remaining blocks. Stage 3: Households Selection As shown in Table 1.3, the number of households selected in each block varied by stratum. This design resulted in 4,001 household units, which aimed to obtain approximately 3,000 completed interviews under the assumption of a 75% response rate for all strata. Table 1.3: Distribution of households by blocks, according to stratum Stratum Definition (N° inhabitants) Number of households per block Greater Santiago 5 Greater Valparaíso 5 Greater Concepción 5 Big cities &gt; 100 thousand 3 Medium cities &gt; 30 thousand 3 Small cities &gt; 10 thousand 3 Total 4001 We conducted a simple random sample of households in each block. The combination of population proportional to sampling size in the first two stages and simple random sampling in the third and fourth stages resulted in a sample of households with approximately equal probability within each of the nine strata. The probability of selection of a household \\(k\\) in block \\(j\\) in city \\(i\\) and stratum \\(h\\) was: \\[\\pi_{k|j,i}=\\frac{nh_j}{NH_j}\\] where \\(nh_j\\) is the number of households selected in block \\(j\\), and \\(NH_j\\) represents the number of enlisted households in block \\(j\\). Stage 4: Individuals Selection Interviewers visited each selected household and attempted to perform the interview. The first step in the interview process was to identify the target respondent. When more than one adult was in the household, we selected one using a simple random sample through a Kish table. The probability of selection of a person in household \\(k\\) was: \\[\\pi_{l|k,j,i}=\\frac{1}{NP_j}\\] where \\(NP_j\\) is the number of adults (over 18 and under 75) living in household \\(j\\). Stage 5: Increasing sample size During the fieldwork of the first wave (2016), we observed that the assumption of a 75% response rate for all strata was incorrect. First, the overall response rate was lower than 75%, and second, there was significant heterogeneity in response rates between regions. Because of this, we decided to increase the number of households per block to achieve the 3,000 interviews effectively. The increase in households per block has a limited effect on the probability of selection of each household. It only affects the probability calculated in Stage 3, since the number of households available is lower, but there is no change in the probabilities calculated in Stages 1 and 2. This occurs because we used the blocks selected (in Stage 2), and no new blocks were introduced. We added 1,082 new households to the study sample during this process, located within the selected blocks. The allocation of these new households was not uniform across all blocks in the country. Instead, they concentrated on four regions: Coquimbo, OHiggins, Metropolitana, and Biobío, where interviewers had the most problems contacting respondents. Table 1.4 details the communes in which the number of households increased concerning the initial design and the total number of households incorporated per block. Table 1.4: Number of households added to the sample by region and commune Region Commune Total added households Households added per block Coquimbo Coquimbo 24 2 La Serena 28 2 Salamanca 22 2 OHiggins Doñihue 10 1 Rancagua 42 2 Santa Cruz 11 1 Biobío Chiguayante 24 3 Concepción 75 3 Coronel 11 1 Penco 4 1 Quillón 6 1 San Pedro de la Paz 28 2 Metropolitana Cerrillos 9 3 Colina 12 3 Curacaví 14 2 El Bosque 8 2 Estación Central 12 3 Huechuraba 6 2 Independencia 6 2 Isla de Maipo 39 3 La Cisterna 9 3 La Florida 24 2 La Granja 6 2 La Pintana 12 2 La Reina 9 3 Las Condes 33 3 Lo Barnechea 9 3 Lo Espejo 6 2 Lo Prado 6 2 Macul 8 2 Maipú 32 2 Ñuñoa 16 2 Padre Hurtado 6 3 Pedro Aguirre Cerda 6 2 Peñaflor 30 2 Peñalolén 14 2 Providencia 7 3 Pudahuel 14 2 Puente Alto 32 2 Quilicura 12 2 San Bernardo 16 2 San Joaquín 6 2 San Miguel 9 3 San Ramón 6 2 Santiago 120 3 Vitacura 9 3 Successive wave sampling design in Original Sample The sample design for the successive waves is equivalent to the original sample design. The households added and respondents selected during 2016 and those added during Stage 5 were re-interviewed in the follow-up waves. Matías Garretón, CIT researcher, provided census block and census district numbers. Census sub-districts are smaller geographic units than communes but larger than blocks. "],["dis_muest_refresco.html", "1.2 Sampling Design Refreshment Sample", " 1.2 Sampling Design Refreshment Sample In 2018, we included a refreshment sample, intending to counteract the effects of attrition (see Survey attrition). Its design is explained below. Sampling Frame Setup for Refreshment Sample At the date of preparation of the sampling frame for the refreshment sample, the 2017 Census databases were not yet available to use as a sampling frame for households; we decided to use as a sampling frame the census of households conducted by the CMD during the 2016. The registration lists households surveyed in person in the first round of the ELSOC survey (Original sample) and therefore consists of the blocks selected for the Original sample survey. This includes about 40,000 households in 1,067 blocks (see Stage 2: Block Selection). Given that when generating the sample design for the refreshment sample, the registration is two years old, there may be problems of non-coverage in the registered blocks. Additionally, 179 segments have less than 20 households registered; we did not consider these segments to select the new sample. If a chosen segment was not residential, we picked a replacement in the sample selection. The selection process of households and interviewees was again carried out in 4 stages: Stage 1: City Selection To select cities, we decided to use the same cities as the original sample, attending the registration conducted by the CMD. Thus, the sample design of the Refreshment Sample is equivalent to the sample design of the Original Sample up to Stage 1 of City selection. Stage 2: Blocks Selection The selection of blocks followed a simple random sampling among those present in the CMD registry and those selected for the Original Sample. We took this decision considering that it simplifies the data collection process by not altering the blocks to be visited (thus increasing the productivity of the survey) and allows maintaining similar representativeness concerning the original sample. However, we discarded before selection blocks with fewer than 20 households or that were part of the pilot survey for the 2018 Refreshment Sample. This means a reduction of the universe of available blocks from 1047 to 822. Finally, since the Refreshment Sample has a target size of 1400 individuals, 402 blocks were selected. Table 1.5 shows the registered, available and selected blocks, according to the region: Table 1.5: Available and selected blocks, by region Region Registered blocks Blocks &lt; 20 households Pilot blocks 2018 Available blocks Selected blocks Tarapacá 23 3 0 20 8 Antofagasta 24 3 0 21 9 Atacama 51 18 0 33 18 Coquimbo 73 22 0 51 23 Valparaíso 159 28 0 131 70 Metropolitana 283 32 20 231 100 OHiggins 47 7 0 40 16 Del Maule 92 24 0 68 32 Biobío 143 34 0 109 64 La Araucanía 94 24 0 70 38 Los Ríos 22 6 0 16 9 Los Lagos 25 3 0 22 10 Aysén 11 1 0 10 5 Total 1047 205 20 822 402 Stage 3: Housholds Selection We selected households by simple sampling among the households in the selected blocks. Given that it is defined to obtain 1,400 surveys selecting an average of 3.5 households per block is necessary to meet the target sample. For this purpose, in blocks with more than 20 households, we selected between 4 and 6 households per cluster, depending on the size of the strata and blocks. In blocks with more than 50 households, we used another sub-block generated in the registration, ensuring that this sub-block is not in the same building already selected. The probability of selecting the same household in the block is non-zero, so a replacement was generated for that unit with the same random selection method, for which we verified the selected sample with the panel sample already defined in 2016. Stage 4: Individuals Selection As in the Original Sample, interviewers visited each selected household and attempted to perform the interview. The first step in the interview process is to identify the target interviewee, who is selected using a simple random sample of adults between the ages of 18 and 75 who live in the dwelling. "],["dis_ponderadores.html", "1.3 Weighting Design", " 1.3 Weighting Design Considering that we want to extrapolate from the interviews conducted to the respective target population, it is necessary to weigh each interviewer appropriately according to their representation in the target population. For this purpose, in each wave of the study we provide weights that allow to adjust for differences in demographic attributes of the ELSOC sample relative to the target population. Below we describe the process of elaboration of weights^ [These weights can be understood as cross-sectional weights since we ignored the problems derived from their longitudinal nature.] in order to achieve correspondence between the sample and the target population. Such weighting corresponds to the inverse of its probability of selection or inclusion in the sample. In this case, the probability of selection of individual \\(i\\) from household \\(j\\) belonging to block \\(l\\) of stratum \\(k\\), \\(P_{ijlk}\\) is given by: \\[P_{iklk} = \\pi_i|_{jlk}\\pi_j|_{lk}\\pi_{lk}\\] Where: \\(\\pi_i|_{jkl}\\) is the probability of selecting an individual \\(i\\) in the sample given the selection of the household where they live and the block location. \\(\\pi_j|_{lk}\\) is the probability of selecting a household \\(j\\) in the sample given the selection of block \\(l\\) (containing household \\(j\\)). \\(\\pi_lk\\) is the probability of selecting block \\(l\\) of stratum \\(k\\) in the sample. The design or theoretical weight \\(w_{ijlk}\\) is defined as the inverse of the selection probability: \\[P_{ijlk}=\\frac{1}{w_{ijlk}}\\] The value of the aforementioned probabilities is: \\[\\pi_{lk} = n_k\\frac{M_{kl}}{M_k}\\] \\[\\pi_{j|lk} = \\frac{m_{lk}}{M&#39;_k}\\] \\[\\pi_{i|jlk} = \\frac{1}{N_{jlk}}\\] Where we have that \\(n_k\\) is the number of blocks to select from stratum \\(k\\), \\(_lk\\) is the number of households in block \\(l\\) of stratum \\(k\\), \\(M_k\\) is the total number of households in stratum \\(k\\), \\(m_{lk}\\) is the number of households to survey within block \\(l\\), \\(M&#39;_k\\) is the updated number of households in block \\(l\\) post-registration, \\(N_{jlk}\\) is the number of persons in the target population living in household \\(j\\) in block \\(l\\) of stratum \\(k\\). Based on the above, weights adjust based on the base probabilities, with non-response adjustment, with adjustment to the number of cases3 and to the number of cases and sex variable4. It should be considered a total target population between 18 and 75 years old based on the regional population projections. The four weights designed are cumulative. For example, the second weight adjusts for selection probabilities and incorporates also the adjustment for non-response. "],["dis_ins.html", "Section 2 Instrument Design", " Section 2 Instrument Design The data collection instrument consists of a structured questionnaire (survey type) applied face-to-face to all participants. We used CAPI system (Computer-assisted personal interviewing) for the interviewing. Exceptionally, we changed to CATI system (Computer-assisted telephone interviewing) during the 2021 wave due to the COVID-19 contingency (more details in the section 2021 Questionnaire: survey during COVID-19 pandemic.). The questionnaire design measures a series of conceptually relevant aspects that characterize Chiles levels of conflict and social cohesion, emphasizing its evolution over time. The main topics of analytical interest addressed by the survey correspond to the modules in which it is structured: Citizenship and Democracy. Social Networks and Intergroup Interactions. Legitimacy and social inequality. Social conflict. Neighborhood. Health and well-being. Socio-demographic characterization. Gender (added to the survey from 2019 onwards). "],["dis-cuestionario.html", "2.1 Questionnaire design", " 2.1 Questionnaire design We developed the original ELSOC questionnaire design in 2015 and covered the planning of waves 2016 and 2017. The section Questionnaire changes between waves describes the differences between subsequent questionnaires. Most of the questions, scales and/or items included in the ELSOC modules come from other public opinion studies, research -in psychology, sociology, economics, political science- conducted by national and international academics, and social surveys conducted in Chile and other countries. Additionally, some COES members developed scales or adapted them from their previous studies. The questionnaire design took advantage of the main technical recommendations and state of the art in the different areas that the study includes. In order to meet the criteria and quality standards for questionnaires, as well as to make the multiplicity of COES research agendas compatible, we decided to develop a working procedure for the construction of the questionnaire. This process originated in 2015 through different phases: COES investigators proposed research projects that pondered a theoretical approach and hypotheses to support the scales submitted for inclusion in the questionnaire. Proposals were presented individually or collectively, and there were no restrictions on the number of items to be suggested. The only requirement was an explicit theoretical foundation involving longitudinal hypotheses and an operationalization of the constructs to be measured in the different items proposed. The process above involved the reception and organization of many research agendas materialized in more than 750 items (single questions or part of a scale). ELSOC team systematized the proposals received, classifying the items into thematic areas. At the same time, we developed mechanisms to reduce the number of items and coordinated meetings between COES researchers to decide on them. The selection criteria were mainly theoretical, prioritizing the fundamental questions for the longitudinal analysis of the research projects and their concordance with the COES agenda. We also included practical criteria, deleting identical or very similar items, previous evidence on the quality of the items (previous surveys, especially the cross-sectional survey developed by COES in 2014), and the general design of the study (sample design, unit of analysis, type of informant, etc.). After selecting the most relevant scales for each proposed topic, we carried out a pilot study of the questionnaire. This involved testing 430 items, with the CMD of the University of Chile in charge of executing the study. Based on the pilot results, the panel team adjusted some items and prepared a suggestion to reduce them in number. COES researchers evaluated the proposal. The last stage of questionnaire adjustment focused on identifying the most conceptually relevant aspects for COES and weighing the methodological requirements for its empirical evaluation. Thus, we classified the items according to the number of measurements required, distinguishing between permanent items (which will be measured in all waves since they constitute the analytical core of the study) and intercalated items (which will be measured only once or every other wave). The final version of the instrument consists of a structured questionnaire (survey type) that is applied face-to-face to all participants annually, with 326 items or questions in total. Changes in the questionnaire between waves As described in the previous section, we classified ELSOC questions into permanent and interleaved items since we do not measure some variables in all waves. Accordingly, the questionnaires implemented present differences between the different waves of the survey. In addition, the questionnaires had not originally planned modifications due to a constant process of evaluation of the quality of the instrument applied. This results in the change or elimination of questions, the inclusion of new items motivated by context, or the emergence of new research agendas relevant to ELSOC. An additional issue that impacted the questionnaire is the average interview duration. In 2016 the average duration per interviewer was 55 minutes. CMD recommended to the ELSOC team to reduce the interview time to 45 minutes on average, given that a longer time implies greater fatigue in the interviewers and interviewees, negatively affecting the quality of the survey. For this reason, we decided to shorten the length of the study. The ELSOC team, together with COES researchers, defined different adjustments that reduced the size of the questionnaire. While the questionnaire of the 2016 wave contained 326 items, in 2017 the instrument contained 309. Table 2.1 shows the number of items measured in each wave of the study in the Original and Refreshment samples: Table 2.1: Number of items per sample, by wave Wave Items in original sample Items in refreshment sample 2016 326 0 2017 309 0 2018 297 301 2019 302 303 2021 216 205 2022 313 288 Table 2.2 shows the distribution of the questionnaire modules: Table 2.2: Number of items per module, by sample and wave Module 2016 2017 2018 2019 2021 Original Sample Citizenship and Democracy 98 70 102 98 64 Social Conflict 25 10 17 21 5 Inequality and Legitimacy 28 23 15 35 13 Gender 0 0 0 10 10 Networks and Attitudes 53 69 41 71 40 Health and Wellbeing 29 54 37 13 20 Sociodemographic 57 43 50 16 52 Territory 36 40 35 38 12 Refreshment Sample Citizenship and Democracy 0 0 96 96 71 Social Conflict 0 0 17 21 5 Inequality and Legitimacy 0 0 28 48 32 Gender 0 0 0 10 10 Networks and Attitudes 0 0 41 54 14 Health and Wellbeing 0 0 29 12 18 Sociodemographic 0 0 55 24 54 Territory 0 0 35 38 1 Differences in questionnaires between samples Starting in 2018, the implementation of the Refreshment Sample began. It sought to complement and compensate for the accumulated attrition of the Original Sample. To a large extent, the Refreshment Sample questionnaire is similar to the one in the Original Sample. However, given the considerable number of research agendas and topics relevant to ELSOC, we allowed the inclusion of questions present in only one of the two samples to increase the number of issues covered while maintaining a limited number of questions asked to each interviewee. Table 2.3 shows the number of items shared between both samples per Wave and those present exclusively in the original or refreshment sample. Table 2.3: Items per sample, by precense in Original and Refreshment samples Wave Only original sample Only refreshment sample Both samples Total 2016 326 0 0 326 2017 309 0 0 309 2018 16 20 281 317 2019 26 27 276 329 2021 53 42 163 258 Questionnaire 2021: Survey during the COVID-19 Pandemic Since 2020, given COVID-19, the health crisis has meant significant challenges to general statistical systems and public opinion surveys in particular. The International Labor Organization (ILO, 2020) reports that most national statistical offices had a negative impact on their operations, particularly those conducted on a face-to-face basis. Several organizations have had to transform their face-to-face operations to telephone or web surveys to cope with these problems. To ensure the feasibility of the data production process in the ELSOC 2021 survey and the safety of both interviewees and interviewers, the executive team, together with professionals from the Microdata Center of the University of Chile, decided to adopt a series of measures that implied temporarily moving to a telephone-based questionnaire application (CATI mode). Given that we expected an increase in application times when switching to telephone format, the application of the questionnaire was divided into two calls, called Calls A and B, respectively, with the objective of each having a maximum duration of 30 minutes to reduce the interview application time and avoid respondent and interviewer fatigue. We conducted a pilot survey between December 2nd and 21st, 2020, to evaluate the challenges and methodological changes of the application. This activity was relevant to assessing the technical and methodological aspects of the application change. In this process, we found that the survey time exceeded 30 minutes on average per call, so we decided: Reduce the number of items in the questionnaires. Adjust questions that generated complications based on what we found during the pilot test. We defined the following criteria to reduce the size of the questionnaire: 1) reduce dimensions that have been very constrained by the lockdowns, such as political participation and social interactions; 2) prioritize items based on technical consistency and/or alignment with COES objectives; 3) prioritize items that have fewer than three measurements throughout the study; and 4) maintain critical items at the socioeconomic and health levels, which allow a good diagnostic of the impact of the pandemic and the lockdowns. Regarding the allocation of questions between calls A and B, the main criteria used were: 1) to maintain the quality of the flow of the survey, keeping questions on similar topics in the same call and ensuring that we kept together the batteries of variables sharing the same initial heading; and 2) that we initially asked the essential items associated with the pandemic, lockdown and social outburst to monitor and characterize the respondents during this period. Table 2.4 shows the distribution of items per module for A and B calls by sample type. Table 2.4: Distribution of items per call and sample, wave 2021 Original Sample Refreshment Sample Wave Call A Call B Call A Call B Citizenship 42 22 29 42 Social Conflict 5 0 5 0 Legitimacy and Inequalities 0 13 0 32 Gender 0 10 10 0 Networks and Attitudes 0 40 14 0 Health and Wellbeing 20 0 18 0 Sociodemographic 39 13 39 15 Territory 0 12 1 0 Total 106 110 116 89 Secondly, and linked to the above, the variables with more than five response categories that generated more significant complications to ask in the pilot tests of this survey were adjusted. We present below the items whose response alternatives were reduced and the criteria adopted for each case: Distant Networks Battery [r01, r02 and r04]: This battery asks about the number of people in different occupations and social groups that the respondent knows. Initially, this battery of questions had seven values (1. none; 2. one; 3. between 2 and 4; 4. between 5 and 7; 5. between 8 and 10; 6. between 11 and 15; 7. 16 or more). Since the response ranges do not obey a clear pattern, we decided to ask interviewees for the precise number of acquaintances. Respondents weight [s07]: This variable presents nine response segments, re-established in 5 segments, referencing the weight quintiles reported by ELSOC in wave 2018 in variable s06. Income variables in segments [m14 and m30]: The m14 variable has 16 response segments, while the m30 variable has 30. Both variables were re-established in 5 segments, referencing the income quintiles presented by the Casen 2017 survey. "],["variable-list.html", "2.2 Variable List", " 2.2 Variable List Given the large number of items measured over time, to examine in detail the differences between the instruments applied, we suggest that those interested review the Questionnaires for each measurement. Similarly, we recommend inspecting the Codebook, where all the items measured in ELSOC are included, with detailed information on the waves in which we measured each question, as well as the modifications and other relevant information to use ELSOC data. "],["implem_encuest.html", "Section 3 Survey Implementation ", " Section 3 Survey Implementation "],["general-characteristics-of-the-data-collection.html", "3.1 General characteristics of the data collection", " 3.1 General characteristics of the data collection Executing entity Given ELSOCs quality and transparency standards, an independent institution implemented ELSOC, after a public tender award. We have had three public tenders: in 2016, 2018 and 2020, each covering two study measurements. That is, waves 2016 and 2017 (Original Sample), waves 2018 and 2019 (Original and Refreshment Samples), and waves 2021 and 2022 (Original and Refreshment Samples), respectively. The Micro-Data Center (CMD) of the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Chile has won the three tenders, so it has been in charge of the development of the survey since its beginning. The bidding conditions and agreement with CMD contemplate the highest quality standards and assure adequate protection of the personal contact data from study participants. We describe below some of the criteria and practices applied to ensure the quality of data collection and processing: Questionnaire pilot Each pilot of ELSOC questionnaire followed the ELSOC survey mode to test the instrument and evaluate the operational performance of the survey. The pilot is carried out in the months before the official survey, followed by a round of focus groups with the interviewers to obtain relevant recommendations for the final study. We use the information obtained to introduce changes to the questionnaires and define adjustments to the interviewer training program. We use a random sample from the Metropolitan Region for the pilot process, obtained from the census developed by the CMD for the original sample. Fieldwork planning and execution The selection and training of site coordinators, interviewers and supervisors is a fundamental pillar of the survey. Therefore, it is essential that both coordinators and interviewers fully understand the study and its objective so that they can argue the importance and functionality of the information they are collecting. A first step is the selection of Site Coordinators, who are in charge of leading the team of interviewers in each administrative zone (sites). We select people with experience in this position in previous waves of the project and/or with expertise in complex surveys. In the case of interviewers, we invite those who had participated in previous waves, and the evaluation of their work was satisfactory. We also asked interviewers who had participated in the CMDs last survey projects. For each data collection process, we train interviewers and supervisors on aspects of the study (objectives, coverage, types of interviewees, etc.), methodological characteristics of the application format and the questionnaire. Additionally, we developed and used an Interviewers Manual for Implementing ELSOC, guidance documents and protocols for the application of the questionnaire. These include: Visit Protocol: first contact with the house, first contact with the household and arranging interviews when it is not possible to interview at the time of the visit. Complex Case Protocol: scenario of refusals, the scenario of more than four face-to-face attempts without contact, barriers to access to the household, no contact with the household. It also contemplates recuperation strategies. Questionnaire Application Protocol: description of the study, informed consent, application of questions, handling of interruptions, delivery of gift cards. Field Protocol: information backup, progress control, contact registry. We adapted the documents to meet the follow-up requirements of a previously interviewed sample. Fieldwork quality control and assurance From the beginning of the survey and throughout its execution, supervision and quality control strategies are constantly carried out, aimed not only at monitoring the progress of the study but also at detecting early and in real-time errors that occurred during the survey, behavioural problems among the interviewers, among other aspects. We have implemented the following early warning strategies and corrective measures during the survey process: The site coordinator reviews 100% of the surveys collected in terms of the observations recorded by the interviewer. This stage verifies that the person chosen in the sampling process has actually been interviewed and confirms the correct filling out of the route sheet, schedule and duration of the interview. We supervise surveys collected by people other than the team of interviewers who conducted the registry. For this purpose, a randomly selected percentage of the sample (between 10 and 25% of the complete sample, depending on the wave) is re-contacted to verify the answers to key questions, detect and correct in time any possible biases of the interviewer team, application errors, and potential serious faults such as falsification of the surveys. Weekly feedback to interviewers from zone chiefs, based on survey review and supervision results. Ongoing verification of the information collected by the central team to the database and validation registry. Weekly report to the COES team informing on the state of progress of the survey. Monitoring Strategy An essential aspect of ELSOCs ongoing operation is to ensure that we follow up with the interviewees selected in the sample over time. Therefore, we defined loyalty and monitoring strategies to reduce attrition. Some of the measures implemented are: Obtaining, saving and updating relevant information to ensure adequate contact: name of the interviewee, contact information (telephone number and e-mail), and essential aspects for identification. We save and use this information following strict confidentiality standards. Conduct pre-contact to arrange interviews and plan the field before the survey date. Each interviewer receives from the site coordinator data on appointments made with ELSOC participants and uses a specific interview protocol for re-interviews. Formation of teams of interviewers with varied profiles, favouring those with experience in previous waves of ELSOC or other complex surveys. The interviewers and coordinators are trained in elements specific to the position and technical aspects of the questionnaire and the study, emphasising the interview protocol. Use of letters of introduction for each interviewee, signed by the Director of the Microdata Center, explaining the studys objectives, the institutions in charge, the guarantee of confidentiality of the data and the granting of an incentive. Grant a monetary incentive to the interviewees after completing the survey. The incentive is a Giftcard for supermarkets or related businesses. The incentive was $6,000 during the 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 waves. During the 2021 wave, the monetary incentive was increased to $9,000. Re-contact in the event of rejections or reach problems with interviewers other than the original one, who must have a profile appropriate to the observed characteristics of the not achieved sample and more significant experience in applying similar surveys. These interviewers have an additional economic incentive to implement surveys defined as recovered. In cases where the respondent has moved, we ask the interviewers to inquire about the new address and make efforts to interview the respondent at the new address. This applies both to address changes at the commune level in the same region, or another commune in a different region. In the latter case, they forward the folio to the coordinator in charge of the respondents new commune of residence. Christmas greetings or similar gestures are sent to ELSOC participants by e-mail on relevant dates. In addition, we provide brochures with the main results of previous waves so that interviewees know about the uses of the collected data and its relevance to the country. "],["incidents-in-the-survey-application.html", "3.2 Incidents in the survey application", " 3.2 Incidents in the survey application Specific events associated with the implementation of the 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 waves are detailed below: 3.2.1 2016 Wave Implementation The survey implementation lasted over 20 weeks, from August to December 2016 (see Figure 3.1). We distributed 132 interviewers in 4 work sites for the field implementation, each one led by a trained group coordinator. The period was more extended than initially predicted (we estimated it to last between 8 and 12 weeks, but we finally extended it to 20 weeks). The main difficulties encountered and the measures adopted to solve the events were as follows: In its technical proposal, the CMD committed to a fieldwork period of 8 weeks. This time estimate was based on recent studies but was inadequate given the difficulties in accessing the sample and its dispersion. The biggest problem occurred in the Metropolitan Region, which, unlike the other regions, did not consider an oversized sample according to historical response rates in household surveys with a random selection of interviewees. We expanded the sample to solve this problem (see Stage 5: Increasing the sample size for more details), which resulted in an additional survey period. We encountered difficulties in recruiting and retaining interviewers for the project due to the problem of accessing the sample and its dispersion, which made the proposed payment to the interviewers, compared to other parallel projects (inside and outside the Center), relatively less attractive. To solve this problem, we gradually increased the amount paid and the flexibility provided to the interviewers. CMD accorded the final closure of the survey fieldwork in agreement with COES once the totality of the oversized sample was covered5. We closed the fieldwork with 2,984 surveys completed. Figure 3.1: Number of weekly interviews, wave 2016 Data collection indicators The following are the Response Rate 1 (RR1, as defined by AAPOR), Cooperation Rate 1 (COOP1), Refusal Rate 1 (REF1) and Contact Rate 1 (CON1)6 Table 3.1: Response, Cooperation, Refusal and Contact Rates, wave 2016 Indicator Original Sample Contact Rate 72.6% Cooperation Rate 86.0% Refusal Rate 8.9% Response Rate 62.4% Data correction for anomalous cases: 2016 and 2017 waves In the context of executing the third wave of the ELSOC study (2018), we detected the falsification of a limited number of cases throughout the study in waves 2016 and 2017. During the monitoring stage of the interviewers work in 2018, the Microdata Center (CMD) detected and reported that a set of cases included in the panel sample were faked. Due to the slow progress of ELSOCs 2018 field goals in Tarapacá and Valparaíso, they sent new interviewers and detected these problems. Specifically, they found systematically falsified surveys: conducted with different people than those included in the sample or where the interviewers requested information from third parties. This led to an exhaustive review process, in which we detected 56 faked cases in the 2016 field and 47 in the 2017 field, concentrated in the regions of Tarapacá (11 cases in 2016 and 11 in 2017) and Valparaíso (45 cases in 2016 and 37 in 2017). CMDs field strategy focuses on experienced interviewers, assigning the same cases to the interviewers over time, according to the recommendation of the specialized literature. The problem focused on some specific interviewers in those areas, which they did not detect during the field supervision of the first two waves. The fake cases represent 1.9% of the actual sample size of ELSOC 2016 (N = 2,984) and 1.9% of 2017 (N = 2,522), so we consider them to have a marginal impact at the overall level. Despite this, we decided to exclude counterfeit cases from the databases, and to generate and make available a corrected version of the 2016 and 2017 databases. We fixed the weights considering the elimination of these cases. To avoid these problems in the future, we modified the supervision protocols, increasing face-to-face oversight and the percentage of cases supervised per interviewer. In addition, we implemented an interviewer rotation system so that the same interviewers do not collect the sample in more than one round. 3.2.2 2017 Wave Implementation Data collection was carried out over twelve weeks, between July and October 2017 (see Figure 3.2). 120 interviewers were distributed in the 17 work sites for the field implementation. The field lasted a more extended period than predicted, as it was estimated to last nine weeks, finally extending to twelve. However, data collection was faster than the first wave, which lasted 20 weeks. This quicker time was due to the availability of contact information for the interviewers obtained in the previous wave. The duration of the fieldwork over the original estimate responded to how challenging it was to contact the interviewees in the Metropolitan and Valparaíso regions. The closure of the survey fieldwork took place once the entire sample was covered. We completed the fieldwork with 2,521 surveys conducted. Figure 3.2: Number of weekly interviews, wave 2017 Data collection indicators The following are the Response Rate 1 (RR1, as defined by AAPOR), Cooperation Rate 1 (COOP1), Refusal Rate 1 (REF1) and Contact Rate 1 (CON1): Table 3.2: Response, Cooperation, Refusal and Contact Rates, wave 2017 Indicator Original Sample Contact Rate 88.7% Cooperation Rate 93.1% Refusal Rate 6.0% Response Rate 82.6% 3.2.2.1 Falsified cases in wave 2017 After the procedures applied by the CMD in 2018, we found and corrected anomalies in surveys conducted in 2016 and 2017. For more details of the problem and its correction, see Data correction for falsified cases: Waves 2016 and 2017. 3.2.3 2018 Wave Implementation We developed the fieldwork between August and December 2018, with an estimated time (15 weeks, approximately) (see Figure 3.3). There were 189 interviewers distributed in 18 work sites to execute the fieldwork. We included the refreshment sample during this fieldwork, which generated a difficulty for the interviewers since they had to explain and motivate the participation of families and interviewees in the study. On the other hand, interviewees of the follow-up sample (Original sample) of 2016-2017 had contact difficulties due to a higher presence of registered address changes than in previous versions of the survey. 6.9% had moved to a different address. Another challenge we faced in the wave is related to the fake cases detected (see Data correction for fake cases: Waves 2016 and 2017). This problem implied an exhaustive on-site review of these cases, while strengthening the control system, considering the following: Increase the percentage of surveys monitored from 10% to 15% in 2018. This ensures the control of at least 20% of the work performed by each interviewer. For future project waves, we defined a rotation of interviewers of the same interviewee. Registration of the interviewers involved to avoid their consideration in future study applications. Regarding the general dynamics of the work, we created economic incentives for the interviewers to achieve the expected sample. Likewise, we arranged transport mechanisms for the interviewers to cover the entire sample on a schedule. The survey fieldwork ended with the agreement of COES once we covered the entire sample. The fieldwork closed with 2,274 surveys in the follow-up sample and 1,523 surveys in the refreshment sample.

However, due to the Chilean Social Outburst that started on the 18th of October 2019, we suspended the fieldwork until Thursday, the 21st of November, when the data collection finally began. Therefore, we surveyed during the Social Outburst period, making its execution difficult. The work lasted for 13 weeks (we decided to pause the data collection during the last three weeks of February 2020, given the exhaustion of the sample and the field team) (see Figure 3.4). There were 143 interviewers in the field, distributed in 16 work sites, administered by trained zone coordinators.

This change in collecting data introduced a tremendous logistical and operational challenge since ELSOC had surveyed in person since its origins. The COVID-19 pandemic also affected the traditional ELSOC survey date, which we scheduled to begin in October 2020. However, the fifth wave survey started on January 30th, 2021, with the assignment of the sample to trained interviewers. The reasons for postponing the survey period were mainly waiting for more favourable sanitary and lockdown conditions that would allow a face-to-face survey (however, it soon became apparent that it was impossible to maintain the face-to-face modality). We extended the fieldwork until mid-June 2021. Nevertheless, we carried out most surveying between February and April 2021 (see Figure 3.5). Due to sample attrition and the deterioration of the team of interviewers given unsuccessful contact attempts, we decided to change the application methodology per sampling unit in May. We formed a group of interviewers dedicated exclusively to reviewing the sample on a given working day.

In addition, the Codebook includes frequency tables for each question according to wave and sample (continuous and text variables are omitted). We designed the codebook to summarize all relevant information about the variables in the database into a standard format for ease of use. Generally, the variables included in the database take the following form: Longitudinal Code. Variable label Question phrasing Response Codes of response categories Notes Frequency table We present the questions by questionnaire module to facilitate the understanding. The Longitudinal Code is associated with each questionnaire item in the database and codebook. Through these codes, we can identify different items. In the wide form longitudinal database, the code includes *_w01, _w02, _w03, _w04* or *_w05* at the end to denote whether the variable corresponds to waves 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 or 2021, respectively. We included variable labels in the Codebook and the databases. The ELSOC team designed them intending to briefly describe the phenomenon or dimension to be measured7. The questions phrasing follows the labels, including preambles, response codes and categories. In constructing the database, we entered response codes as numerical values and response categories as labels. Finally, we included observations associated with possible changes over time or aspects to be considered when using the variables. The string variables (text) do not present codes since they are literal verbal responses of the interviewers. There are no response categories in items where we request a numerical answer because we record the value indicated by the respondent. We eliminated accents and other symbols not included in all statistical software (e.g. accents and ñ) "],["citizenship-and-democracy-module.html", "7.1 Citizenship and Democracy Module", " 7.1
